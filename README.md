# Description


This challenge involves using object-oriented programming with node.js to delevop an app that essentially builds team profiles based on command line prompt-input sequencing and renders an HTML page to manifest the inputted data into a polished user-readable format.

Similar to the previous challenge that used command lines promts to generate a README file, this challenge purported the same goal, however, the student was assigned the task of creating a layered structure of directories that all served unique functions to do the job. For example, student needed to create a separate folder to organize the different classes to be used and later imported. Additionally, in another separate folder, the corresponding files that contain code to "test" the class files was also done. This pushes the student onto a much more sophisticated path of coding challenges because now we have a rather complicated structure of files that are intended to organize the logical basis of what the code intends to accomplish. It's intimidating but a step by step methodical approach seemed to make the process go right along toward success. Lastly, a separate javscript file needed to be created that used object-literals to plant the html code into the javascript functions (or vice versa).

At the end, it's very rewarding to see everything come together nicely. We end up with an app that asks a series of questiosn related to the said team members, and then a resulting webpage that nicely displays profile cards.

# Usage

- - **This walkthrough video demonstrates the functionality in real-time: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1asnIahywhXR5KmbPlOLegbBMUDpIrVIQ/view**

**The below description and screenshots also demonstrate some of the program's back-end coding.**

## User is able to run jest testing to observe that all class coding passes tests.

![]()
  
## User invokes program by entering “node index.js” into the command line and is presented with questions.

![]()



## User enters each team member's name, email, id, and other characteristics depending on the type of role they play on the team. 

![]()



## Once finished, user sees a newly-generated HTML file in the dist folder of the repository.
